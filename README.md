Weather Monitoring System

This project aims to identify the temperature and humidity in the surrounding environment using the DHT22 sensor. The DHT22 sensor is a digital temperature and humidity sensor that provides accurate and reliable data.

Software - Wokwi

Components required:-
1. Arduino Board (e.g. Arduino Uno)
2. LCD (16x2) I2C display
3. DHT22 Sensor
4. Connecting wires

Procedure:-
1. Connect the VCC of the DHT22 sensor to the 5v pin of the Arduino. Similarly, Connect the VCC of the 
   LCD (16x2) I2C display to the 5v pin of the Arduino.
2. Connect the GND of the DHT22 sensor to the GND pin of the Arduino. Similarly, Connect the GND of 
   the LCD (16x2) I2C display to the GND pin of the Arduino.
3. Connect the SDA of the DHT22 sensor to the digital pin 2 of the Arduino.
4. Connect the SDA and SCL to the A4 and A5 of the analog pin of Arduino respectively.
